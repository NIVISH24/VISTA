# VISTA: Voice & Insider Surveillance for Threat Assessment

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**License**: MIT

---

## üìù Overview

VISTA is a cutting-edge endpoint monitoring and authentication platform specialized in passive surveillance and real-time behavioral analytics to detect insider threats proactively. By leveraging voice biometrics, keystroke dynamics, hardware event monitoring, and AI-powered video analytics, VISTA delivers a robust multi-layered security solution with seamless integration into Linux-based systems.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Layered Endpoint Agent

* **Lightweight Installation**: Installable via PyInstaller (Python) or Rust-based binary.  
* **System Fingerprinting**: Gathers MAC address, CPU ID, disk and RAM serials, OS version.  
* **Hardware Event Logger**: Detects USB insertion, NIC changes, hardware swaps, with timestamps.  
* **Mic Listener (Voice Biometrics)**:  
  * Captures 15s audio snippets.  
  * Extracts voice embeddings using Wav2Vec2.  
  * No raw audio stored‚Äîensures privacy.  
* **Keystroke Dynamics**: Tracks timing, intervals, and pressure patterns.  
* **Mouse & App Monitoring**: X/Y tracking, click patterns, app launches, active windows.  
* **Offline Buffering**: Auto-sync on network reconnection.  
* **Security-First Encryption**: AES-256, agent self-checks, tamper detection.  

### 2. Voice + Password Multi-Factor Authentication (Linux PAM)

* **Seamless PAM Integration**: CLI-based voice enrollment & challenge-response.  
* **Real-Time Speaker Verification**: Random phrase validation with Wav2Vec2.  
* **Fallback & Policy Control**: Password-only mode after configurable failure count.  

### 3. Threat Detection & AI Engine

* **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest on behavioral time-series.  
* **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Real-time composite risk score (0‚Äì100) based on:  
  * Voice confidence  
  * Keystroke anomaly  
  * Hardware activity  
  * Device context  
* **Prototype Matching**: FAISS-backed quick similarity search.  
* **Per-User Thresholds**: Continuously updated using EMA.  

### 4. Security & Surveillance Dashboard

* **System Overview**: Health status, active sessions, alerts.  
* **Live Feed**: Suspicious events like USB inserts or failed voice attempts.  
* **Forensic Timeline**: Chronological event explorer with detailed plots and voice vectors.  

### 5. Visual Intrusion Detection (AI-Powered)

* **Camera Integration**: Monitors facial presence and motion anomalies.  
* **Intrusion Detection**: Alerts on unauthorized personnel.  
* **Visual Forensics**: Logs video metadata with behavioral data for cross-correlation.  

### 6. Seamless Deployment

* **Cloudflare-Enabled**: Secure, fast backend routing.  
* **Custom Domain**: Deployed on production-ready infrastructure.
