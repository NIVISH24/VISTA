# VISTA: Voice & Insider Surveillance for Threat Assessment

**Version**: 1.0.0
**License**: MIT

---

## üìù Overview

VISTA is a next-generation endpoint monitoring and authentication platform designed for passive surveillance and real-time behavioral analysis to detect insider threats. By combining biometric voice authentication, behavioral profiling, and hardware event monitoring, VISTA provides security teams with proactive alerts, forensic insights, and seamless multi-factor authentication on Linux systems.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Endpoint Agent

* **Lightweight Installation**: Rust-based binary (\~30MB) or Python agent via PyInstaller.
* **System Fingerprinting**: Collects MAC address, CPU ID, disk serials, RAM serials, OS & patch level.
* **Hardware Event Logger**: Tracks USB insertions, new NIC attachments, RAM/SSD swaps, with timestamps.
* **Voice & Behavior Streamer**:

  * **Mic Listener**: Captures 15-second audio windows; extracts embeddings (no raw audio stored).
  * **Keystroke Dynamics**: Records key‚Äëdown/up durations, inter‚Äëkey intervals.
  * **Mouse Analytics**: Logs X/Y movements, velocity, click timing.
  * **Application Usage**: Monitors app launches, active window focus, login/logout times.
* **Offline Buffering**: Caches all captured data locally when offline; auto-syncs on network restoration.
* **Encryption & Integrity**: AES-256 wrapped data, agent self-integrity check, tamper alerts.

### 2. Voice & Password MFA Integration

* **PAM Module for Linux**: Seamless plug‚Äëin using libpam.
* **Enrollment CLI**: Record voice samples; generate user voice profile.
* **Authentication Flow**:

  1. Password prompt
  2. Voice challenge (random phrase)
  3. Real‚Äëtime speaker verification
* **Failover**: Falls back to password-only after threshold failures; configurable policies.

### 3. Threat Detection & ML Engine

* **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest on time-series behavior data.
* **Voice Stress Classifier**: Wav2Vec2 embeddings + XGBoost for stress/hesitation cues.
* **Risk Scoring**: Weighted fusion of hardware, behavior, and voice models into a 0‚Äì100 score.
* **Prototype Authentication**: Rapid nearest‚Äëneighbor search via FAISS index on user prototypes.
* **Dynamic Thresholding**: Per-user & global thresholds, EMA-based prototype updates.

### 4. Security Dashboard

* **Overview Panel**: Active agents, health status, last check‚Äëin, suspicion scores.
* **Heatmap View**: Org‚Äëwide risk distribution by department & location.
* **Live Alerts Feed**: USB events, failed voice auth, high-risk behavior spikes.
* **Forensics Explorer**: Timeline view of events, raw feature plots, and audio embeddings.
* **Reporting**: Scheduled PDF/CSV exports with compliance-ready audit trails.
* **RBAC & SSO**: LDAP/Active Directory integration, JWT-based API auth.

### 5. Deployment Modes

* **On‚ÄëPremise**: Docker Compose & Helm charts available.
* **Hybrid**: Local data ingestion + optional cloud analytics module.
* **Air‚ÄëGapped**: Model updates via signed USB packages.
